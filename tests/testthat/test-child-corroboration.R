# Corroboration of the GA correction (added 2026-05-23) and the UER3 unit-error
# selection in Evil Twins. Small constructed subjects; measurements chosen so
# the relevant z-scores and unit-error ratios are unambiguous.
#
# Correction corroboration: a subject's low first weight only earns GA
# correction if true prematurity is corroborated by EITHER
#   form 1 -- a consistent early weight trajectory (>= 2 weights < 2y whose
#             corrected early spread is no worse than uncorrected), OR
#   form 2 -- a same-day HEIGHTCM *or* HEADCM at the first weight that is itself
#             low (uncorrected z <= -1.5) AND no more than 3.5 z above the first
#             weight's uncorrected z (so a merely-somewhat-low HT/HC cannot
#             corroborate a far-lower, e.g. misplaced-decimal, birth weight).
# A misplaced-decimal birth weight (low weight, normal same-day length, no
# consistent early follow-up) is corroborated by neither, so its correction is
# withdrawn and the implausible value is caught by the trajectory steps.
# Because form 1 / HT / HC are ORed, HC only decides the outcome when there is
# no weight-trajectory corroboration and no confirming HT.

# Assert on the Detailed code (keeps the step-level Exclude-C-* literals);
# the default `exclude` carries the consolidated Summary code.
