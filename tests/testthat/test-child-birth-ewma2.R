# Regression coverage for two 2026-05-24 changes that the broader fixtures
# (regression / stress / fix1) do not exercise:
#
#   Change 4 -- Step 15 birth HT/HC fix. For an HT/HC subject-param with exactly
#   3 valid values where one is a birth (agedays 0), the birth is kept as a
#   normal Step 15 participant (in the EWMA, exclusion-eligible) instead of being
#   stripped -- which previously dropped the whole SP below the processing count
#   and let an extreme non-birth value survive to Include. The classic miss was a
#   wildly high HC a few days after a normal birth HC (the value was the last
#   Include, so Step 11 protected it; Step 16 only scores the birth; HC velocity
#   has no short-interval ceiling) -- so only Step 15, now reachable, catches it.
#
#   Change 2 -- isolated low uncorrected birth-WT guard. A birth weight that is
#   uncorrected, low (tbc.sd < -2), and isolated (next weight >= 2y away) is only
#   excludable if |tbc.sd| + (tbc.sd[next] - tbc.sd) > 7, so a fairly-plausible
#   low birth weight is not dragged out by a distant string of high weights.

# Build all probe subjects in one frame; cleangrowth processes per subject.
