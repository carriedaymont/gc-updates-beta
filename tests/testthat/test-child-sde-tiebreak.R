# =============================================================================
# Child same-day-identical tiebreak (Tier 1 testing-gaps: T2).
#
# When a (subjid, param, agedays) group holds identical values, one is kept
# (Include) and the rest are "Exclude-Identical" (the shared Summary code).
# The keeper is chosen by an AGE-DEPENDENT internal_id rule:
#   agedays == 0 (birth): keep the LOWEST id (the earliest reading, before
#     postnatal fluid shifts);
#   agedays  > 0:          keep the HIGHEST id (the later, more careful reading).
# A regression flipping this would net to a zero count delta and pass every
# frozen-count test, so it is asserted here on exact ids.
#
# Per feedback_run_dont_derive, the codes/ids below were confirmed by running
# cleangrowth() on this subject before freezing.
