# Extend the Fenton 2025 LENGTH reference below its lower boundary.
#
# Background: in fenton2025_ms_lookup_smoothed.csv the weight and headcirc
# curves start at ga_days = 157 (22+3 weeks), but the length curve starts at
# ga_days = 164 (23+3 weeks). The weight->gestational-age lookup
# (fent_foraga, after the 500 g floor) can produce GA estimates as low as
# 157 days. So for the most premature infants, the earliest LENGTH row has a
# post-menstrual age in [157, 163] that falls below the length reference and
# therefore receives no GA correction (sd.corr falls back to the uncorrected
# z), while weight/HC at the same age are corrected. That leaves a single
# uncorrected, extreme-negative length z sitting in an otherwise-corrected
# trajectory.
#
# Fix: linearly extrapolate the length M, S_upper, S_lower below the 23+3
# boundary down to 22+3 (ga_days 157), matching weight/HC. The slope is taken
# over the lowest one-week span available in the table (23+3 -> 24+3, i.e.
# ga_days 164 -> 171); the low end of the length curve is essentially linear,
# so this is a faithful continuation. For a target ga_days g (157..163):
#   value(g) = value(164) - (164 - g) * (value(171) - value(164)) / 7
# applied independently to M, S_upper, and S_lower, per sex.
#
# Idempotent: if any length row below ga_days 164 already exists, do nothing.
# Appends the new rows to the CSV (existing rows untouched) for a minimal diff.
